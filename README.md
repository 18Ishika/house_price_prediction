HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION  
Overview  
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as size, location, number of bedrooms, etc. It utilizes machine learning techniques to build predictive models and provides insights into the factors influencing house prices.  
  

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset].


    
Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.  

Feature Engineering: Extracted additional features such as age of the house, distance to amenities, etc., to improve model performance.  

Model Selection: Experimented with various machine learning algorithms including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to find the best performing model.  
  
Model Evaluation: Evaluated models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to assess prediction accuracy.  

  
Results
Achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of [RMSE] on the test dataset.And tested the accuracy on basis of Random Forest Classifer Algorithm  

Achieved a accuracy of about 80%
